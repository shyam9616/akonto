                                <h2 class="section-title">What are cookies?</h2>

                                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website and mobile application owners in order to make their websites and apps work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

                                <p>Cookies do a lot of different jobs which make your experience of the Internet much smoother and more interactive. For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to help you navigate between pages more efficiently. They also help ensure that the advertisements that you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. Much, though not all, of the data that they collect is anonymous, though some of it is designed to detect browsing patterns and approximate geographical location to improve user experience.</p>

                                <p>If you visit our website, mobile site, or use our mobile apps, we will deploy cookies and similar technologies like JavaScript to provide an online service more suited to the device you connect from, as well as to prevent and detect fraud, to help keep you secure. When you visit our website from any device (e.g. mobile device or PC), we collect information about your use of this site, such as information about the device or browser you use to access the site (including device type, screen resolution, etc.), the way you interact with this site, and the IP address your device connects from. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning, e.g. you may not be able to initiate or complete some activities within our secure online services unless these cookies or similar technologies are installed.</p>

                                <h2 class="section-title">What types of cookies are there?</h2>

                                <p>Broadly speaking, there are four types of cookie: strictly necessary cookies, performance cookies, functionality cookies and targeting or advertising cookies.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><u>Strictly necessary cookies</u> are essential to navigate around a website and use its features. Without them, you wouldn’t be able to use basic services.</li>
                                    <li><u>Performance cookies</u> collect anonymous data on how visitors use a website; they can’t track users, and are only used to improve how a website works.</li>
                                    <li><u>Functionality cookies</u> allow users to customize how a website looks for them: they can remember usernames, language preferences and regions, and provide more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located.</li>
                                    <li><u>Advertising and targeting cookies</u> are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you, but can also limit the number of times you see an advertisement, and be used to chart the effectiveness of an ad campaign by tracking users’ clicks. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Additionally, these cookies are divided further into two sub-types.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><u>Persistent cookies</u> remain on a user’s device for a set period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</li>
                                    <li><u>Session cookies</u> are temporary. They allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2 class="section-title">How do I control and delete cookies?</h2>
                                <p>The ability to disable or delete cookies can also be carried out by changing your browser’s settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually found in the ‘Help’, ‘Edit’ or ‘Tools’ facility). If you disable all cookies, some pages may not work.  If you switch off cookies at a browser level, your device won't be able to accept cookies from any website.</p>
